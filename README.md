It is necessary to create a small graphical editor with <canvas> element.

Requirements:

1. User should be able to draw with the cursor
2. User should be able to change the color of the brush
3. User should be able to erase with the cursor
4. User should be able to reset <canvas>

‘Undo-redo’ mechanism implementation will be a plus.
This logic should be implemented using pure JS only.
Interface needs to be developed using ‘React’.

Additional requirements:

1. Use JS spec ES6 and higher
2. Use JS classes
3. Use OOP and design patterns
